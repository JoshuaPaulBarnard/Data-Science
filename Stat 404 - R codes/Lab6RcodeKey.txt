# AGR seems to have strong negative correlations with SPS (r=-0.81) and 
# SER (r=-0.604), likewise between MIN and MAN (r=-0.67).
# The strongest positive correlation is between SPS and TC (r=0.47) and
# SER and CON (r=0.47).  On the other end of the spectrum, the correlations
# closest to zero are FIN and CON (r=-0.02), SER and MAN (r=-0.03), and
# CON and MAN (r=-0.03). MIN, and to a lesser degree PS, is frequently very 
# small with just a few values not near zero.

#AGR and MIN are contrasted with all the other variables in creating PC1.
# So this is more of a natural resources vs. service economy.

#This is harder to figure out.  For PC1, cereals , nuts/oils/seeds,
#and vegetables are positive while the other variables (flesh and starch)
#are negative.  This suggests countries to the left of zero are more
#flesh/starch oriented while those to the right are more plant based.
#PC2 is heavy on fish, vegetables, and starch.

#2f
#This continues to be not so obvious.  PC1 suggests plant based diet (other
#than starch - potato?) vs. flesh diets.  PC2 emphasizes fish and vegetables.
